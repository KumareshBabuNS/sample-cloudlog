# Logging levels cloud example

This application shows how logging levels can be changed when an app is deployed to Cloud Foundry.

## Local

----
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/sample-cloudlog-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

Note the log output has `INFO` and `DEBUG` messages:

----
...
2016-06-07 17:46:05.543 DEBUG 9904 --- [           main] com.example.cloudy.CloudyApplication     : This is a debug message
2016-06-07 17:46:05.543  INFO 9904 --- [           main] com.example.cloudy.CloudyApplication     : This is an info message
...
----

## Cloud

----
$ mvn clean package
$ cf push clogging -p target/sample-cloudlog-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

Note that only `INFO` log is now output

----
$ cf logs --recent clogging

...
2016-06-07 17:48:07.325  INFO 9904 --- [           main] com.example.cloudy.CloudyApplication     : This is an info message
...
----

## Why

The `application.yml` contains the following:

[source,yaml]
----
---
spring:
  profiles: default

logging.level.com.example: DEBUG

---
spring:
  profiles: cloud

logging.level.com.example: INFO
----

There are two configs here. `cloud` is automatically applied by the buildpack when the app is pushed to Cloud Foundry.
The `default` profile is applied when no other profiles are active.
